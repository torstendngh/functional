## 🙌 Motivation

I live in Germany but use an English keyboard. Typing characters such as ä, ö, ü, or ß usually involves Windows' awkward character-picker. While tools like Microsoft PowerToys Quick Accent exist, I saw this as a chance to build a complete program from scratch and demonstrate my coding skills in a concise, self-contained project.
