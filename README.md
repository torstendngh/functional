# **functional** - Small Note-Taking App

A straightforward note-taking application with an extra pane for special characters from other languages, making it easy to copy them to the clipboard. Right-click any note to switch to edit mode.

## Motivation

I live in Germany but use an English keyboard. Typing characters such as ä, ö, ü, or ß usually involves Windows' awkward character-picker. While tools like Microsoft PowerToys Quick Accent exist, I saw this as a chance to build a complete program from scratch and demonstrate my coding skills in a concise, self-contained project.

## Technologies used

- Electron - cross-platform desktop runtime
- TypeScript
- React + Tailwind CSS for the UI
- SQLite 3 for local data storage
- Vite and npm for tooling
- Microsoft Fluent System Icons
- Designs created in Figma
